# <b>SimpleTools Spigot Plugin</b>
This is my first java plugin. I made it for practising what I learned in college. I will update it with everything I think of. It hasn't a specific utility, just random commands.

## <b>Commands</b>

> `[] - optional argument`<br>
> `<> - required argument`

* `/spawn [player]` - Gets you or a player to the default spawnpoint of the world. Specifically to X+500 and Z+500 to spawn in the middle of the block and not in the intersection of four blocks.
* `/freefall <player>` - Throws a player from their Y+200.
* `/thunder <player> <times>` - Strikes a player with thunder n times.
* `/discord` - Sends you my discord server invitation link, in case you wanna hang out with great people.
